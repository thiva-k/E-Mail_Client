# E-Mail_Client
A Command-line Based Automated Email client application | CS1040

A Command-line Email client application that manages two types of recipients (official and personal) from a text file. Users can add new recipients via the command-line interface, and the application maintains recipient objects. On recipients' birthdays, automated greetings are sent based on their type (official friends or personal). The system also saves sent emails using object serialization and allows users to retrieve sent email details by date. Key features include recipient count tracking and user-friendly command-line options for managing recipients, sending emails, and retrieving email logs.
